#Exhiliration and Happiness

##Millions of Happy Faces.......(Dreams turn True After all :) )

YesterDay was One of the Best Days of My College.This year turned to be Greater Than Last Year.

#3800 offers for 2100 People.

This richly speaks of the Efforts of Everyone Involved with THe Process.The TNP department had put their Hearts in the process to turn dreams into Reality and the efforts bore fruits as now everyone's status has changed to #placed and thanking their parents and Peers.I had not a shadow of doubt on the people who now stand victorious On the realm of MASS.Every Company here is A Big Name which provides great Growth Scope.

YesterDay Our Founder addressed us as to understand the Relevance of this Day and Thank our Parents and dedicate this to them.Because He gave a Very simple but subtle logic as to till 12th,
Our parents Toiled with us,As the success that we have achieved is a culmination of 12th and the undergraduate basics.

Everyone were sweating their hands and palpitations and All extreme Emotions and their Doubts as how they would fare in this Examination,when it was Announced that their Results had been already Uploaded on The College Website.Everyone took out their Mobiles and started announcing their and their friend's Success.Bluetooth and GPRS became one of the most used Features.And Smiles and Hugs and Laughter could be heard in the Horizons.I congratulated all of them nad celebrated their Happiness with Them.

Best of Luck to all of them for their Future Endeavours too !!
