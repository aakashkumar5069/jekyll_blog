# Data Limit Exceeded

## When the meter is mine,You have to do according to it ! :smirk:

![Data limit Exceeded]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/dle.gif)

*You are walking along the Same road but it's Neverending....You can see the Destination but never reach it....When will the week end And the Administrator will give u a new lump of Data to utilize .*

*This seems as a matter of concern to a lot of Engineers all over India where Their respective colleges have a decently less as an allowance for Internet !.Recently Windows 10 came into the picture and It downloaded all the updates on its own And to my dismay , Everything was gone ! *

*This situation may lead to alot of Emotions at the same instant of time.Mine was Anger because this is one of the most basic facilities that needs to be provided by the college. **100% Internet Facilities** as every college pamphlet reads but Nobody knows the limitations to this rule .What could be worse than letting down the Entertainment quotient so that u can utilise Gmail for the whole week (A important mail can drop in anytime,Sir!!).*
