#The Wish Fulfilled

##"It was Experience of a Lifetime to Finally get the Perfect Day to enjoy my Endeavours and Savour it ."

This was sort of a dream come true.I had not even expected this sort of a Resut .
It is rightly said that God does things in a mysterious way,And you could never sense a miniscule of it !
It all started with the presentation and the  *innovation + u* appealed to me on which they were focussing on people rather than their own Resources.A company which remains strong on 37,000 patents and The leader of its fied with 40% market seizure of the old as well as the Latest technologies.
It thrives on the 3 pillars namely perseverance and respect.

There was an online test which was an easy cocubes test .I had got stuck in a relations question which had two sub parts but as I took a deep breath,The question revealed itself in a minute or so.There was a particular flow chart question which seemed difficult but was the easiest question on the questionpaper.It aws a time to accuracy duel.Therefore,consuming time in a section tok its toll,I could not attempt 3 in quant,but all of the others were solved by me and I was pretty confident on them.The most sceptical section was English .Since I had Chances,I went to the Auditorium To hear the results.I was in and we were Directly sent for the Gds.
Since it was my Second Gd as such,I was less focused on Nervousness and more on Finding the right and logical points to speak.The topic that came to us was "Was Education Necessary "  


THe next day,was the Personal Interviews,I was the 11th candidate,therefore It took them half an hour to send me for my Technical.As I was waiting outside,I took a look at the sorting techniques.And then I was sent in.
I got a very friendly HR.We started with pleasantries and then he went on to ask about my hobbies,We talked on that.His next statement ws to choose the subject I was most comfortable with,
I started with C,A quicksort algorithm was asked,
Then Networkink,all the Osi Layers and its functionalities.
After explaining that,I was asked about Connectionless vs Connection-oriented wih Examples.And why Video Conferinging uses Connectionless.
I was asked to explain difference between object and class with examples.
Then the project was asked,I told him about it .And he gave me suggestions as to How we could improve that !
It was a 30-45 minutes interaction.

I was sent to sit for in the Auditorium.If I had got through this round,Then i would be called for the Hrs.I was aware that The Percentage of conversion from Hr round was good,But It was necessary that I cross the Hr rounds.As these thoughts were going through my mind,I was called in for the Hrs,I was exhilarated.

The HR round was a fine stroke. We disussed normally on hobbies,the company policies,my woorking conditions nad preferences.All of those and Happiness(He saw my photo and said that even assuming that you grow a beard u would look like this but There is a very different Hairstyle in front of me nad the person in the photo).It was a fine Day and at te end of It,I felt satisied as to What I answered.

But I had to wait for the Final Verdict.
