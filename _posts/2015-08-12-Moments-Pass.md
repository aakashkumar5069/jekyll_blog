# Moments Pass

## While I stand still.....

Things have not been good of late.While I stand still with my firm foot on the ground,People do have managed to move to a better level,endeavouring towards success .

While I stand still,Looking towards the sky as to when I will be able to do the same.Somewhere envyng some while actually Happy for the deserving ones.The same feeling comes to my mind,I messed it (Or else I would also have been on the Hall of fame).As the next wave comes,I hope to cross this stage and get drenched in happiness.I am not aware what God has in store for me ......

Every Day seems the same.There is no Difference Factor.

**Wake up,Do some Aptitude,some Programming Language,Surf the internet and sleep.**

I am as if at a stranded place with no means of coming back to the mental level of calmness and satisfaction.(I try to,but it constantly bugs me as to What I should do.....).
