##All seems worth the effort of 2 long years when you can see your name on the list.

**The Days Close to Expected Result Date:**
Opening Pagalguy's IIFT Page had become second nature. I used to check it almost every 15 mins.One of the very few perks of working in an IT environment was having access to stable internet.I used to sneak out some time in my work hour when I would open the Pagalguy page in a new window and referesh it whenever I felt free.In between SQL queries my anxiety also used used to load as soon as I got minor updates.

**The Day Pdf was uploaded on the website:**
I had a Tuesday weekly call with the client where we used to discuss action points on current issues.I got an update on Facebook on various CAT group that the result has been uloaded. I found the file uploaded on the group.A flash came to my mind when last year I didnot feature on the list and missed the cutoff buy 0.14 in Total.Mustering some courage I downloade the file.Saw the clock,I had 10 mins to the call.
I took the decision to check for my name.I didnot have the courage to search for full name therefore I entered "Kumar" in the search criteria.Got 19 results,started scrolling next nxt then finally found my name on the 199th row.Time froze for a second and I did not know how to react.I messaged my best friend regarding it and joined the meeting.
Thankfully the meeting got over in half the time.I knew I had to confirm again by downloading the PDF from IIFT's official website.And there my name was on the 199th row.I could only break this news with my closest circle because this was just level 1.And the game just got tougher.

**ScoreCard:**
Aware that I had qualified for the interview process,I wanted to know the score that woyuld make 60% of the qualifying selection criteria.It would help me determine the amount of hardwork that I needed to put in to convert my best call this year.This was my shot to get inside the gates of the best Trade school in India and holds a position among the top ten colleges of India.
