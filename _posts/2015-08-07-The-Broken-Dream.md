# The Broken Dream

## "If you got a dream,protect it." If you couldnot,Then you can understand me....

Any person on earth wants to change his future.And such a strive toards achieving that is one of the best attempts he could think of,towards defining his existance and claiming his future.
One such occasion came towards me....Something had caught my eyes for long and its sparkle was unresisting.And so I derived a way of having it with the assistance of people who had succesfully altered their destiny.But Then two importand things come in....**LUCK** and **Destiny(Are U destined to get it or not)**.


The Process...
1.The initial Day Testing and Selection process was successfully Nailed By me.

2.The Conversation Rounds with People having the Same Mindset has mine,was Also a successful attempt.And this was my First try at step 2.(Ultra level of Happiness :) )

3.The D-Day:Lot of People Hovering(All talented ,maybe some of them having **THAT skill** more than me.).I was positive and constantly reminded myself of the dream.And as I had expected,I wasn't nervous.I was willing to take the challenge But as luck may have it,They found the Achilles heel(I faltered :( ) . And the Dream shattered.......
