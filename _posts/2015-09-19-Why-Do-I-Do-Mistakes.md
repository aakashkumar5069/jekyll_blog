#I do make Grave Mistakes

##"Why Do I do that ??"

Something's been buzzing me since my Childhood.Why do I do mistakes ?I am aware of the outcome of my actions,but sometimes I still cross that line !. I am time and again reminded of what i do and what could happen.It normally leads to a state I am fixed as to how I would resolve the newly created problem and then I question why didi I take the first step.Had I not taken my first step,I would not have worsened the situation.

My action is the result of two things,firstly being,I want to solve my problem on my own(Because I am very secretive as to my issues,I take as my own challenge to conquer and vanquish sometimes not realising that neither do I have the resources nor the tools to tackle the situation.) and secondly,I do not like people getting involved with my issues.

But Everything on Earth got to have results even if we like it or Not.It just messes the problem even further rather tha solving it.But at the end,we realize that this is not the way to do it and it is added to our list of Not-Dos.

We can surely derive inspiration from Sir Thomas Alva Edison's words.
