## I am Happy :)

*Cause This seems to be to be my first step into The blogging world.I used to write personal stuff but this seems as a way to digitalise it.And sharing my views to Everyone.I have a certain feeling that anyone could easily align his field of thought towards mine.I have certain view ,Maybe Someone has a completely different one but I have reason to have that view for sure.*  :stuck_out_tongue:

*And if u are also a *Noob* facing an issue getting into the Github Jekyll Blogging world U surely need to check out...Youtube Videos and This particular website helped me a lot !*
